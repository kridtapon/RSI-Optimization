# RSI-Optimization
The RSI is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. It oscillates between 0 and 100 and is typically displayed as a line on a chart, which moves in tandem with the assetâ€™s price movement.

When used effectively, RSI can improve the profitability of algorithmic trading strategies by identifying favorable entry and exit points. However, default parameters (like the standard 14-day period) might not always yield the best results for every market or asset.

Optimizing RSI involves tuning its parameters, such as the period and overbought/oversold thresholds, to improve strategy performance.
